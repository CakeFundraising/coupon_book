            What Types of Information Do We Collect and How?
        </p>
        <h5>
            PERSONAL INFORMATION.
        </h5>
        <p>
            In order for you to make purchases and donations through the Sites, register with the Sites, or take certain other actions on the Sites , we may require
            you to provide us with applicable information that personally identifies you (&#8220;Personal Information&#8221;). Personal Information includes the
            following types of data:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Contact Data such as name, mailing address, e-mail address, and Cake user-name, account number, and password </li>

          <li> Social Media information such as friend lists, likes, photos, and other information </li>
        </ul>
        <h6>
            How do we collect Personal Information?
        </h6>
        <p>
            We collect Personal Information when you provide it to us, such as when you create an account, make a donation, create a campaign, enter a contest or
            sweepstakes, take other actions on the Sites, and at other times. We also collect Personal Information from social media sites and services when you use
            your social media account to log into the Sites or use the Sites to take other actions on social media, such as sharing or liking a fundraising campaign.
        </p>
        <h6>
            Traffic Data.
        </h6>
        <p>
            As is true of most websites, we automatically collect certain information when you visit our Sites. This information includes: (i) IP addresses, (ii)
            domain servers, (iii) types of computers accessing the Sites, (iv) types of web browsers used to access the Sites, (v) referring/exit pages, (vi) data
            about usage patterns throughout the Sites (e.g. click rates on different links etc.). Information of this type (&#8220;Traffic Data&#8221;) is anonymous
            information that does not personally identify you but is helpful for us to improve the business performance and user experience of the Sites.
        </p>
        <h6>
            How do we collect Traffic Data?
        </h6>
        <p>
            As is true of most websites, we use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer or device to identify your computer and web browser) to collect
            Traffic Data related to the Sites. We use Service Providers (defined below) to place cookies on your computer or device to compile this non-personally
            identifiable information so we can aggregate statistical information about usage of the Sites. Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.
            You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent, however, certain features of the Site or Services may not
            work if you delete or disable cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Sites also contain web beacons, which are electronic images that are used along with cookies to compile statistics so we can analyze how the Sites are
            being used. Our e-mails may also contain web beacons so we can track how many people open the message or click on links within the message. This
            information helps us improve our communication and marketing efforts. We use a Service Provider to gather information on how you and others are using the
            Sites. By using this service we are able (for example) to see how many people visited a given page or clicked on a given link. This information helps us
            optimize the performance of the Sites.
        </p>
        <h6>
            Is my Personal Information kept confidential?
        </h6>
        <p>
            Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy or agreed by User, we will keep your Personal Information private and will not share it with other
            third parties unless such disclosure is necessary to: (i) comply with a court order or other legal process, (ii) to protect our rights or property, (iii)
            in connection with our sale, merger, consolidation, change of control, or transfer of substantial assets, or (iv) to enforce our Terms of Service. Please
            keep in mind that while we take reasonable precautions to safeguard your Personal Information no amount of protection can guarantee its security.
        </p>
        <h6>
            Who has access to my Personal Information?
        </h6>
        <p>
            We share your Personal information with other business partners who assist us in performing core services related to the operation of the Sites
            (&#8220;Service Providers&#8221;). These Service Providers only use your Personal Information to perform these core services, which are necessary for the
            orderly operation of the Sites, such as hosting and maintenance, data storage and management, security, payment processing, and marketing and promotions.
            Each Service Provider must agree to use reasonable security procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information involved, in order to
            protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unless you donate anonymously, any organization you make a contribution to, or purchase from, through the Sites will have access to your Personal
            Information (except for your credit card number or other payment account information). If you make a donation or purchase through an individual fundraising
            page, then the person who created the fundraising page will also have access to your Personal Information (except for your credit card number or other
            payment account information). If you make a donation or purchase through an individual fundraising page associated with a fundraising team, or directly to
            a team fundraising page, then the person who created the team page will also have access to your Personal Information (again, except for your credit card
            number or other payment account information). You consent to the foregoing and agree that we are not responsible for how these organizations or persons
            handle your Personal Information. You should contact them directly for their privacy policies and data usage practices. From time to time, businesses or
            other entities will run campaigns to benefit charities through the Sites. In such a situation, your Personal Information (except for credit card number or
            other payment account information) may be accessible to the business or other entity running the campaign.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please remember that after we disclose Personal Information to third parties, we can no longer control the use of such Personal Information. Accordingly,
            Cake will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any third party.
        </p>
        <h6>
            How does Cake use my Personal Information?
        </h6>
        <p>
            We use your information in a variety of ways to help us run the Sites, provide services to you, and communicate with you. Here are some examples of the
            ways we use your information:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>To facilitate the processing of a transaction between you and a third party</li>
          <li>To send you receipts</li>
          <li>To send you updates about the Sites</li>
          <li>To send you updates about activity on the Sites related to you</li>

          <li>To respond to customer service inquiries</li>
          <li>To send marketing materials</li>
          <li>To improve our Sites and marketing efforts</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>
            Who has access to my payment information?
        </h6>
        <p>
            Cake contracts with Service Providers to process all donations and payments made through the Sites. Only the third party processors have access to your
            credit card number or other payment account information. We do not have access to your credit card number or other payment account information, nor do the
            organizations to whom you pay or donate, or the people who create fundraising pages. Data handled by the third party processors is subject to theirs terms
            and privacy policies. Please contact us at the contact information below for any additional questions about your payment information and how payments are
            processed.
        </p>
        <h6>
            What other information is public?
        </h6>
        <p>
            Information you post on the Sites, event pages, campaign pages, personal fundraising or pledge pages, your profile (unless hidden), a charity or sponsor
            profile, blog posts, or other public pages on the Sites can be accessed by other people. You should exercise caution when deciding to share information on
            public pages. We cannot control who accesses shared information or how other parties will use that information.
        </p>
        <h6>
            What choices do I have?
        </h6>
        <p>
            It&#8217;s up to you whether or not you want to provide us with Personal Information. You can still visit the Sites without providing us with Personal
            information, but you will be unable to take certain actions without doing so.
        </p>
        <h6>
            How can I update or correct my Personal Information?
        </h6>
        <p>
            If you have registered (and therefore have a profile) you can update your information by clicking on &#8220;Account Settings&#8221; which is accessible at
            the top of your screen once you&#8217;ve logged in.
        </p>
        <h6>
            Security
        </h6>
        <p>
            No data transmission over the Internet or other network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect information
            transmitted on or through the Sites, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information you transmit on or through the Sites, and you do so at
            your own risk.
        </p>
        <h6>
            Links To Other Websites
        </h6>
        <p>
            Our Sites may contain links to or frame other websites or allow others to send you such links. A link to or framing of a third party&#8217;s website does
            not mean that we endorse it or that we are affiliated with it. We do not exercise control over third-party websites. You access such third-party websites
            or content at your own risk. You should always read the privacy policy of a third-party website before providing any information to the website.
        </p>
        <h6>
            Children&#8217;s Privacy
        </h6>
        <p>
            We understand the importance of protecting privacy especially where children are involved, and we are committed to doing so. Our Sites are for a general
            audience and are not targeted towards children. In order to protect the privacy of children, our Sites do not knowingly collect personal information from
            children under the age of 13 without prior parental consent. If your child has used the Sites and submitted Personal Information to us, please contact us
            and we will endeavor to remove that information from the Sites and our database.
        </p>
        <h6>
            Processing in the United States
        </h6>
        <p>
            Please be aware that your Personal Information, communications, and other information may be transferred to and maintained on servers or databases located
            outside your state, province, or country. If you are located outside of the United States, please be advised that we process and store all information in
            the United States. The laws in the United States may not be as protective of your privacy as those in your location. By using the Sites, you agree that the
            collection, use, transfer, and disclosure of your Personal Information and communications will be governed by the applicable laws in the United States.

            5. Deals
        </h5>
        <p>
            Cake provides consumers with opportunities to purchase certain products and services (each a &#8220;Deal,&#8221; and collectively, &#8220;Deals&#8221;)
            from third-party merchants (each the &#8220;Merchant&#8221;), except as otherwise expressly identified, using a time-limited promotional voucher
            exchangeable for Merchant goods and services (a &#8220;Voucher&#8221;). The promotion of each Deal works as a form of advertisement for the Merchant by
            Cake.
        </p>
        <p>
            By purchasing, printing, accepting, using or attempting to use any Voucher, you agree to these Terms, the fine print identified in the Deal copy (defined
            below) and/or any additional deal-specific terms related to the Deal at the time of purchase. These Terms apply to all Vouchers, unless the Fine Print on a
            particular Voucher states otherwise, and except as otherwise required by law. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and the Fine Print on a
            Voucher, the Fine Print will control, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law.
        </p>
        <h6>
            Additional Deal Terms
        </h6>
        <p>
            Some categories of Deals have special terms that vary from the general deal terms stated in this Section 6. These special terms which are set forth here.
            Any other varying terms for specific Deals will be set forth in the Fine Print.
        </p>
        <h6>
            How it Works
        </h6>
        <p>
            By placing an order for a given Deal, you are agreeing to purchase the Deal you have selected on the terms, restrictions and conditions associated with the
            Deal. Once you have placed your order, you will receive a confirmation of the Deal and your credit card or other payment mechanism will be charged for the
            amount of the Deal. We will notify you by email when the Voucher for the Deal is ready to be used.

        <h6>
            Deal Value and The &#8220;Fine Print&#8221;
        </h6>
        <p>
            In addition to the terms set forth herein, each Deal comes with its own set of restrictions, terms and conditions (collectively, the &#8220;Fine
            Print,&#8221; whether or not they are expressly labeled as such on a Voucher). The Fine Print may restrict things such as when or where You can redeem a
            Voucher, as well as other Deal-specific limitations, so always read carefully.
        </p>
        <p>

            Date-Specific Deals
        </h6>
        <p>
            Sometimes we offer Deals that are date-specific, such as a Deal for a ticketed event or a Deal where you select a specific day to stay at a hotel
            (&#8220;Date-Specific Deal&#8221;). Usually this means that the Voucher can only be redeemed on a single date or that you might have to choose from a list
            of available dates before you buy a Voucher. In either case, the date you select will be identified on the Voucher, and you can only redeem the Voucher on
            this specified date. You may not reschedule a Date-Specific Deal for another date or time for any reason. No full or partial refunds are given to customers
            who fail to redeem a Date-Specific Deal on the date specified on the Voucher.
        </p>
        <h6>
            Refunds:
        </h6>
        <p>
            Vouchers are not refundable.
        </p>
        <h6>
            Merchant is the Issuer
        </h6>
        <p>
            The Merchant is the issuer of the Voucher and is solely responsible for redeeming the Voucher. The Merchant is also solely responsible for all goods and
            services it provides to you and for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs it may cause you to suffer, directly or
            indirectly, in full or in part, whether related to the use or redemption of a Voucher or not, as well as for any unclaimed property liability arising from
            unredeemed or partially redeemed Vouchers. Unless otherwise indicated in a Deal or other offer, Cake is solely the marketer of the Merchant&#8217;s goods
            or services, and may from time to time engage third parties or affiliates to administer Voucher management on behalf of Merchants. You hereby irrevocably
            waive all rights related to, and release Cake and its subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, officers, directors, employees and agents from, any liabilities
            arising from or related to any act or omission of a Merchant in connection with your use of a Voucher or the products and/or services it provides in
            connection with it.

            Deal Availability
        </h6>
        <p>
            Some Deals are not available for purchase beyond certain geographical and jurisdictional boundaries. Cake reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
            exclude or otherwise limit the provision of a Voucher, the Sites, the Services or any other product or service. Cake does not represent or warrant that any
            product or service promoted on the Site will be available for purchase by any particular person. Some of our Deals are limited in number. Any attempt by
            you to obtain more than the permitted number of Vouchers specified for a particular Deal, including, without limitation, using multiple or different
            identities, credit cards, forms, registrations or addresses, will void your purchase and may subject your Account to termination. Whether purchase
            characteristics constitute an attempt to violate our rules shall be determined at our sole discretion.
        </p>
        <h6>
            Pricing Information
        </h6>
        <p>
            We display discounts on our Sites in connection with each Deal. These discounts are calculated based upon certain pricing information provided to us solely
            by Merchants, which may include the retail price suggested by the manufacturer, supplier or the Merchant, or an estimated price based on standard industry
            practice. Since the pricing information on which we base our discounts may vary, any discount information that we display may or may not be representative
            of the prevailing discount in every area or on any particular day.
        </p>
        <p>
            The price of Vouchers (or other products and services) will be as quoted on our Site from time to time, except in cases of obvious error. Cake strives to
            provide accurate pricing information regarding the products and services available on the Site. We cannot, however, insure against pricing errors. Cake
            reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to not process or to cancel any orders placed for a product or service whose price was incorrectly posted on
            the site as a result of an error. If this occurs, Cake will notify you by email. In addition, Cake reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to correct
            any error in the stated full retail price.

            Cake does not accept unsolicited submissions for business ideas, web sites, articles or other products or services. It is our intent to avoid the
            possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by or on behalf of Cake (whether internally or by third parties) might seem to others to be
            similar to their own creative ideas or materials. Therefore, please do not make any such unsolicited submissions to Cake through the Sites, by email, text

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, any dispute or claim arising out of or relating in any way to your visit to the Sites, your purchase or redemption of a
            Voucher or your use of the Services made available through the Sites, these Terms, this Agreement, the Privacy Policy or the validity or enforceability of

            your local jurisdiction. This agreement and any arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the
            same damages and relief (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) as a court, and must follow the provisions of these Terms as a
            court would.

        <p>
            To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent. The arbitration will
            be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration
            Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA&#8217;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA&#8217;s rules are available at
            http://www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment fees will be governed by the AAA&#8217;s fee schedule for Consumer Arbitration Costs. You and Cake
            may be able to recover attorney&#8217;s fees in arbitration as you/we would in court if they are available under applicable law. For any claim that could
            otherwise be brought in small claims court, the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on written submissions. A decision by the arbitrator (including
            any finding of fact and/or conclusion of law) against either you or Cake shall be confidential unless otherwise required to be disclosed by law or by any
            administrative body and may not be collaterally used by either you or us in existing or subsequent litigation or arbitration involving any other person or
            Cake customer.
        </p>
        <p>
            We both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement, unauthorized access or trespass to computer networks or any other misuse,
            misappropriation or theft of intellectual property rights. We also each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an
            individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. The arbitral tribunal shall have the power to rule on any challenge to its own
            jurisdiction or to the validity or enforceability of any portion of this agreement to arbitrate. If any part of this arbitration provision is held
            unenforceable, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the
            unenforceable provision were not contained. If, however, the class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entire arbitration provision shall
            be null and void. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial and agree that we shall
            litigate exclusively in the courts located in Washington, D.C.
        </p>

            16. Indemnity, Reservation of Right, Release
        </h5>
        <p>
            You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Cake and its officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, damages,
            obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your use of and
            access to Cake; (ii) your violation of any term of these Terms or this Agreement; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including, without
            limitation, any copyright, property or privacy right; or (iv) any claim that any User Content submitted by you causes damage to a third-party. This defense
            and indemnification obligation will survive the termination of this Agreement and your use of the Sites and/or Services.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cake reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or take action regarding disputes that you may have with other users, customers or any
            Merchants. To the extent the law permits, you release us from any claims or liability related to any Content and/or User Content posted on the Sites and
            from any claims related to the conduct of any other customers of ours or any Merchants. You agree to waive California Civil Code Section 1542 (if you are a
            California resident), and any similar provision in any other jurisdiction (if you are a resident of such jurisdiction), which states: "A general release
            does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him
            must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."

            17. Applicable Law
        </h5>
        <p>
            By using our Services, you agree to these Terms and you further agree that any claim or dispute between you and Cake that arises out of this Agreement
            shall be governed by the laws of the Maryland without regard to conflict of law principles, except that the arbitration provisions contained herein shall
            be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.

            19. Entire Agreement, Changes to this Agreement and Waivers
        </h5>
        <p>
            These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy, and any other legal notices published by Cake on the Sites, Services or any Voucher, shall constitute the
            entire agreement between you and Cake concerning your use of the Sites and/or Services. We may occasionally change the Terms and the Terms of this
            Agreement, and any such modifications will become effective once they are posted to the Site. It is your sole responsibility to check the Sites from time
            to time to view any such changes to the Terms. Your use of the Sites and/or Services after any modifications to the Terms will indicate that you accept and
            agree to the modified Agreement, provided that these changes will not apply to Vouchers purchased prior to the effective date of such modification. These
            modifications will however be effective immediately for new users of our Sites and/or Services and for all Vouchers purchased after the effective date of
            the modification. Any changes to this Agreement (other than as set forth in this paragraph) or waiver of Cake&#8217;s rights hereunder shall not be valid
            or effective except in a written agreement bearing the physical signature of an officer of Cake. No purported waiver or modification of this Agreement by
            Cake via telephonic or email communications shall be valid.
        </p>
        <h5>
            20. General Terms
        </h5>
        <p>
            You and we are independent contractors, and nothing in this Agreement creates a partnership, employment relationship or agency relationship. There are no
            third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement. We may assign this Agreement at any time without notice to you. You may not assign this Agreement or your
            rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, to any third-party without our prior written consent, and any attempt by you to do so will be
            invalid. Should any part of this Agreement be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion will be construed consistent with applicable law and the
            remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of the
            right to enforce such provision. Our rights under this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
            YOU AND CAKE AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO CAKE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES.
            OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.
        </p>
        <p>
            You represent that you are legally able to accept these Terms. You affirm that you are either more than 18 years of age, or an emancipated minor, or
            possess legal parental or guardian consent, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations,
            representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement, and to abide by and comply with this Agreement. If you are not legally able to accept these

        <h5>OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h5>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy applies to Eatsforgood.org and all Cake websites, any subdomains thereof, any API integrations or widgets we offer, any other websites
            or webpages we own or operate that include a link to this policy, and any of our mobile applications (all of which together are referred to as the
            &#8220;Sites&#8221;). Please keep in mind that this Privacy Policy does not apply to other websites, which may be accessible from the Sites. External
            websites may have data collection, storage, and use practices and policies that differ materially from those contained here.

        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do so, we will notify you by posting the date of the last change or amendment at the top of this
            page. You agree that this method of notice is sufficient and that you will regularly check this Privacy Policy to see if updates or changes have been made.

            What Types of Information Do We Collect and How?
        </p>
        <h5>
            PERSONAL INFORMATION.
        </h5>
        <p>
            In order for you to make purchases and donations through the Sites, register with the Sites, or take certain other actions on the Sites , we may require
            you to provide us with applicable information that personally identifies you (&#8220;Personal Information&#8221;). Personal Information includes the
            following types of data:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Contact Data such as name, mailing address, e-mail address, and Cake user-name, account number, and password </li>

        </ul>
        <h6>
            How do we collect Personal Information?
        </h6>
        <p>
            We collect Personal Information when you provide it to us, such as when you create an account, make a donation, create a campaign, enter a contest or
            sweepstakes, take other actions on the Sites, and at other times. We also collect Personal Information from social media sites and services when you use
            your social media account to log into the Sites or use the Sites to take other actions on social media, such as sharing or liking a fundraising campaign.
        </p>
        <h6>
            Traffic Data.
        </h6>
        <p>
            As is true of most websites, we automatically collect certain information when you visit our Sites. This information includes: (i) IP addresses, (ii)
            domain servers, (iii) types of computers accessing the Sites, (iv) types of web browsers used to access the Sites, (v) referring/exit pages, (vi) data
            about usage patterns throughout the Sites (e.g. click rates on different links etc.). Information of this type (&#8220;Traffic Data&#8221;) is anonymous
            information that does not personally identify you but is helpful for us to improve the business performance and user experience of the Sites.
        </p>
        <h6>
            How do we collect Traffic Data?
        </h6>
        <p>
            As is true of most websites, we use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer or device to identify your computer and web browser) to collect
            Traffic Data related to the Sites. We use Service Providers (defined below) to place cookies on your computer or device to compile this non-personally
            identifiable information so we can aggregate statistical information about usage of the Sites. Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.
            You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent, however, certain features of the Site or Services may not
            work if you delete or disable cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Sites also contain web beacons, which are electronic images that are used along with cookies to compile statistics so we can analyze how the Sites are
            being used. Our e-mails may also contain web beacons so we can track how many people open the message or click on links within the message. This
            information helps us improve our communication and marketing efforts. We use a Service Provider to gather information on how you and others are using the
            Sites. By using this service we are able (for example) to see how many people visited a given page or clicked on a given link. This information helps us
            optimize the performance of the Sites.
        </p>
        <h6>
            Is my Personal Information kept confidential?
        </h6>
        <p>
            Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy or agreed by User, we will keep your Personal Information private and will not share it with other
            third parties unless such disclosure is necessary to: (i) comply with a court order or other legal process, (ii) to protect our rights or property, (iii)
            in connection with our sale, merger, consolidation, change of control, or transfer of substantial assets, or (iv) to enforce our Terms of Service. Please
            keep in mind that while we take reasonable precautions to safeguard your Personal Information no amount of protection can guarantee its security.
        </p>
        <h6>
            Who has access to my Personal Information?
        </h6>
        <p>
            We share your Personal information with other business partners who assist us in performing core services related to the operation of the Sites
            (&#8220;Service Providers&#8221;). These Service Providers only use your Personal Information to perform these core services, which are necessary for the
            orderly operation of the Sites, such as hosting and maintenance, data storage and management, security, payment processing, and marketing and promotions.
            Each Service Provider must agree to use reasonable security procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information involved, in order to
            protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unless you donate anonymously, any organization you make a contribution to, or purchase from, through the Sites will have access to your Personal
            Information (except for your credit card number or other payment account information). If you make a donation or purchase through an individual fundraising
            page, then the person who created the fundraising page will also have access to your Personal Information (except for your credit card number or other
            payment account information). If you make a donation or purchase through an individual fundraising page associated with a fundraising team, or directly to
            a team fundraising page, then the person who created the team page will also have access to your Personal Information (again, except for your credit card
            number or other payment account information). You consent to the foregoing and agree that we are not responsible for how these organizations or persons
            handle your Personal Information. You should contact them directly for their privacy policies and data usage practices. From time to time, businesses or
            other entities will run campaigns to benefit charities through the Sites. In such a situation, your Personal Information (except for credit card number or
            other payment account information) may be accessible to the business or other entity running the campaign.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please remember that after we disclose Personal Information to third parties, we can no longer control the use of such Personal Information. Accordingly,
            Cake will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any third party.
        </p>
        <h6>
            How does Cake use my Personal Information?
        </h6>
        <p>
            We use your information in a variety of ways to help us run the Sites, provide services to you, and communicate with you. Here are some examples of the
            ways we use your information:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>To facilitate the processing of a transaction between you and a third party</li>
          <li>To send you receipts</li>
          <li>To send you updates about the Sites</li>
          <li>To send you updates about activity on the Sites related to you</li>

          <li>To send marketing materials</li>
          <li>To improve our Sites and marketing efforts</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>
            Who has access to my payment information?
        </h6>
        <p>
            Cake contracts with Service Providers to process all donations and payments made through the Sites. Only the third party processors have access to your
            credit card number or other payment account information. We do not have access to your credit card number or other payment account information, nor do the
            organizations to whom you pay or donate, or the people who create fundraising pages. Data handled by the third party processors is subject to theirs terms
            and privacy policies. Please contact us at the contact information below for any additional questions about your payment information and how payments are
            processed.
        </p>
        <h6>
            What other information is public?
        </h6>
        <p>
            Information you post on the Sites, event pages, campaign pages, personal fundraising or pledge pages, your profile (unless hidden), a charity or sponsor
            profile, blog posts, or other public pages on the Sites can be accessed by other people. You should exercise caution when deciding to share information on
            public pages. We cannot control who accesses shared information or how other parties will use that information.
        </p>
        <h6>
            What choices do I have?
        </h6>
        <p>
            It&#8217;s up to you whether or not you want to provide us with Personal Information. You can still visit the Sites without providing us with Personal
            information, but you will be unable to take certain actions without doing so.
        </p>
        <h6>
            How can I update or correct my Personal Information?
        </h6>
        <p>
            If you have registered (and therefore have a profile) you can update your information by clicking on &#8220;Account Settings&#8221; which is accessible at
            the top of your screen once you&#8217;ve logged in.
        </p>
        <h6>
            Security
        </h6>
        <p>
            No data transmission over the Internet or other network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect information
            transmitted on or through the Sites, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information you transmit on or through the Sites, and you do so at
            your own risk.
        </p>
        <h6>
            Links To Other Websites
        </h6>
        <p>
            Our Sites may contain links to or frame other websites or allow others to send you such links. A link to or framing of a third party&#8217;s website does
            not mean that we endorse it or that we are affiliated with it. We do not exercise control over third-party websites. You access such third-party websites
            or content at your own risk. You should always read the privacy policy of a third-party website before providing any information to the website.
        </p>
        <h6>
            Children&#8217;s Privacy
        </h6>
        <p>
            We understand the importance of protecting privacy especially where children are involved, and we are committed to doing so. Our Sites are for a general
            audience and are not targeted towards children. In order to protect the privacy of children, our Sites do not knowingly collect personal information from
            children under the age of 13 without prior parental consent. If your child has used the Sites and submitted Personal Information to us, please contact us
            and we will endeavor to remove that information from the Sites and our database.
        </p>
        <h6>
            Processing in the United States
        </h6>
        <p>
            Please be aware that your Personal Information, communications, and other information may be transferred to and maintained on servers or databases located
            outside your state, province, or country. If you are located outside of the United States, please be advised that we process and store all information in
            the United States. The laws in the United States may not be as protective of your privacy as those in your location. By using the Sites, you agree that the
            collection, use, transfer, and disclosure of your Personal Information and communications will be governed by the applicable laws in the United States.
